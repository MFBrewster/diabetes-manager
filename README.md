General Assembly Web Development Immersive, Project 2

## Overview and Purpose
THe purpose of this project was to demonstrate coding CRUD actions in a full-stack application. I coded this after having been in GA's web deveopment program for six weeks. The the back end uses Ruby on Rails with a PostgresSQL database, and the front end uses Javascript and jQery to manipulate the DOM.

## User Instructions
Sign up with a username and password, then sign in. Can create "doses". Each dose is stored in the database with a medicine. Users can create new medicines to assign to a dose from the dose window.
